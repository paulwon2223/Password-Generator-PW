## Homework Assignment #3

### Overview:
- For this homework assignment, I was tasked to create a password generator that will generate a password for the users based on the criteria that they have selected.

### Process:
- During my process of creating the password generator, I first created different type of variables which contained its own different values to be used for each criterias (e.g created a variable named 'upperCasing' which stored all uppercase letter).

- After creating the variables, I noticed that the starter code was missing a function method to prompt the different type of questions to the users when the 'generate' button was clicked. To make the button work, I first created a function in the code called 'generatePassword' and wrapped the different criteria prompts within the function.

- To display the final password, a 'return' method was used on variable called 'password', which contained all the result of the different criteria.
